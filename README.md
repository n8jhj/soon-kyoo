# soon-kyoo
A subprocess-based task queue.

:warning:

**WARNING**

This repository is archived because the package has been renamed to SoonQ.
Please refer to the up-to-date repository at https://github.com/n8jhj/SoonQ.

:warning:

## Introduction
Soon-Kyoo implements a simple FIFO queue using SQLite. It was created primarily for running long simulations.

As of yet, the vision of a subprocess-based workflow has not been realized. However, the package still works as a task queue.

## Installation
`pip install soon-kyoo`

## Usage
Users must create their own subclass of `soon_kyoo.BaseTask`. Subclasses must define a `run()` method, which contains the business logic for the task (what we care about). At least for now, input arguments to this method are restricted to being JSON serializable.

## Example

The following can be found in the examples directory.

**timer_task.py:**

    """Script for creating timer tasks.
    """

    import time

    import soon_kyoo as sk


    def timer_sleep_all(interval, n):
        for i in range(n):
            timer_sleep(interval, i, n)


    def timer_sleep(interval, i=None, n=None):
        if None not in (i, n):
            msg = f"{i+1}/{n} "
        else:
            msg = ''
        msg += f"Sleeping {interval} seconds..."
        sk.echo(msg)
        time.sleep(interval)


    class TimerTask(sk.BaseTask):
        """Task to count to a certain number a specified number of times.
        """

        task_name = 'TimerTask'

        def run(self, interval, n):
            """Count at the given interval the given number of times.

            Positional arguments:
            interval - (int) Interval, in seconds.
            n - (int) Number of times to count the given interval.
            """
            self.interval = interval
            timer_sleep_all(interval, n)
            sk.echo(f'Slept {interval * n} seconds total.')


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Create a new task.
        timer_task = TimerTask()
        # Add the task to the queue, to be executed at some future time.
        # Arguments to delay() are the same as for run().
        timer_task.delay(3, 3)

**timer_worker.py**

    """Script for runnning a Worker dedicated to accomplishing TimerTasks.
    """

    import soon_kyoo as sk

    from timer_task import TimerTask


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Instantiate TimerTask.
        timer_task = TimerTask()

        # Run worker.
        worker = sk.Worker(task=timer_task)
        worker.start()

## Running the examples

Example files are included in the examples directory. From within your repository, clone soon-kyoo (will clone into "soon-kyoo" by default)...

`git clone https://github.com/n8jhj/soon-kyoo.git`

...and then install it in editable mode.

`pip install -e soon-kyoo`

Now run the following in two separate terminals:

**Terminal 1:**

Run the same script a few times.

## Etymology
This project is named after my friend, Soon-Kyoo. People call him Q, for short.
